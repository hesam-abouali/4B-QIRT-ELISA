The code in this repository uses NumPy, SciPy, and pandas libraries to facilitate data analysis in a real-time continuous multiplexed ELISA assay. The quantum dot integrated real-time (QIRT)-ELISA system, benefits from a bead-based quantum dot-mediated immunoassay (BQI) to continuously monitor insulin and glucagon in whole blood samples.

This code has been implemented into a Streamlit framework to facilitate an accessible approach to using the QIRT-ELISA system for rapid and real-time measurements.

This code is part of the manuscript with the title "Real-Time Multiplexed Measurement of Blood for Diabetes Biomarkers using a Quantum Dot Integrated Assay"
